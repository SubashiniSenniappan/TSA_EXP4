# Ex.No:04   FIT ARMA MODEL FOR TIME SERIES
# Developed by:SUBASHINI S
# Date: 



### AIM:
To implement ARMA model in python.
### ALGORITHM:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Set up matplotlib settings for figure size.
3. Define an ARMA(1,1) process with coefficients ar1 and ma1, and generate a sample of 1000

data points using the ArmaProcess class. Plot the generated time series and set the title and x-
axis limits.

4. Display the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots for the ARMA(1,1) process using
plot_acf and plot_pacf.
5. Define an ARMA(2,2) process with coefficients ar2 and ma2, and generate a sample of 10000

data points using the ArmaProcess class. Plot the generated time series and set the title and x-
axis limits.

6. Display the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots for the ARMA(2,2) process using
plot_acf and plot_pacf.
### PROGRAM:

OUTPUT:
SIMULATED ARMA(1,1) PROCESS:
